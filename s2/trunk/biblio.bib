  abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel way of stabilization of amorphous
	celecoxib (CEL) against recrystallization by preparing binary amorphous
	celecoxib-octaacetylmaltose (CEL-acMAL) systems by quench-cooling
	of the molten phase. As far as we know this is the first application
	of carbohydrate derivatives with acetate groups to enhance the stability
	of an amorphous drug. We found that CEL in the amorphous mixture
	with acMAL is characterized by a much better solubility than pure
	CEL. We report very promising results of the long-term measurements
	of stability of the CEL-acMAL binary amorphous system with small
	amount of stabilizer during its storage at room temperature. Moreover,
	we examined the effect of adding acMAL on molecular dynamics of CEL
	in the wide temperature range in both the supercooled liquid and
	glassy states. We found that the molecular mobility of the mixture
	of CEL with 10 wt \% acMAL in the glassy state is much more limited
	than that in the case of pure CEL, which correlates with the better
	stability of the amorphous binary system. By dielectric measurements
	and theoretical calculations within the framework of density functional
	theory (DFT), we studied the role of acMAL in enhancing the stability
	of amorphous CEL in mixtures and postulated which interactions between
	CEL and acMAL molecules can be responsible for preventing devitrification.},

  abstract = {We have identified long-lived structural ordering in a model glass-forming
	liquid. A novel cluster-based approach is used to detect local energy
	minimum clusters and a structure-specific time correlation function
	is devised to characterize the degree of free energy minimization
	of each locally preferred cluster. For our system, the lifetime correlation
	function for icosahedral clusters decays far slower than for those
	of similarly sized but topologically distinct clusters. The lifetime
	of icosahedral clusters increases as the domains of icosahedra get
	bigger, and particles neighboring these domains have suppressed mobility,
	providing a mechanism for the development of dynamical heterogeneities
	on cooling. Finally we consider how two structural correlation lengths
	of the domains of icosahedra relate to the four-point dynamic correlation
	length.},
