  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present a novel way of stabilization of amorphous celecoxib (CEL) against recrystallization by preparing binary amorphous celecoxib-octaacetylmaltose (CEL-acMAL) systems by quench-cooling of the molten phase. As far as we know this is the first application of carbohydrate derivatives with acetate groups to enhance the stability of an amorphous drug. We found that CEL in the amorphous mixture with acMAL is characterized by a much better solubility than pure CEL. We report very promising results of the long-term measurements of stability of the CEL-acMAL binary amorphous system with small amount of stabilizer during its storage at room temperature. Moreover, we examined the effect of adding acMAL on molecular dynamics of CEL in the wide temperature range in both the supercooled liquid and glassy states. We found that the molecular mobility of the mixture of CEL with 10 wt \% acMAL in the glassy state is much more limited than that in the case of pure CEL, which correlates with the better stability of the amorphous binary system. By dielectric measurements and theoretical calculations within the framework of density functional theory (DFT), we studied the role of acMAL in enhancing the stability of amorphous CEL in mixtures and postulated which interactions between CEL and acMAL molecules can be responsible for preventing devitrification.},

Utilizing an implementation of the Torquato-Jiao sphere-packing algorithm [S. Torquato and Y. Jiao, Phys. Rev. E 82, 061302 (2010)], we present the most comprehensive determination to date of the phase diagram in (alpha,x) for the densest binary sphere packings.

  Abstract                 = {A glassy state of matter results if crystallization is avoided upon cooling or increasing density. However, the physical factors controlling the ease of vitrification and nature of the glass transition remain elusive. Using numerical simulations of polydisperse hard disks, we find a direct relation between medium-range crystalline ordering and the slow dynamics which characterizes the glass transition. This suggests an intriguing scenario that the strength of frustration controls both the ease of vitrification and nature of the glass transition. Vitrification may be a process of hidden crystalline ordering under frustration, at least in our system.},

  Abstract                 = {We have identified long-lived structural ordering in a model glass-forming liquid. A novel cluster-based approach is used to detect local energy minimum clusters and a structure-specific time correlation function is devised to characterize the degree of free energy minimization of each locally preferred cluster. For our system, the lifetime correlation function for icosahedral clusters decays far slower than for those of similarly sized but topologically distinct clusters. The lifetime of icosahedral clusters increases as the domains of icosahedra get bigger, and particles neighboring these domains have suppressed mobility, providing a mechanism for the development of dynamical heterogeneities on cooling. Finally we consider how two structural correlation lengths of the domains of icosahedra relate to the four-point dynamic correlation length.},
